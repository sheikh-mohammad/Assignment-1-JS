# Question 8 – Variables for Strings

This exercise practices using document.write() to output HTML content through JavaScript.

## Files
- `index.html`: Minimal HTML that includes `script.js`
- `script.js`: JavaScript for this question - uses document.write() to output a message directly to the HTML page

## How to Run
- Open `index.html` in your browser
- Or use VS Code Live Server: right-click `index.html` → Open with Live Server

## Code Explanation
The script demonstrates:
- Using `document.write()` to output content directly to the webpage: `document.write("Yah! I can write HTML content through JavaScript");`
- Writing string content directly to the document

## Expected Output
The text "Yah! I can write HTML content through JavaScript" will be written directly to the HTML page.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to use `document.write()` to output content to a webpage
- Learn how JavaScript can manipulate HTML content
- Practice writing string content to the page using JavaScript

## Tips
- `document.write()` writes content directly to the HTML document
- This method is generally used for demonstration purposes
- Modern JavaScript typically uses other methods like `innerHTML` or DOM manipulation
- The content will appear on the webpage where the script is executed

# Chapter 5: Math Expressions

This folder contains JavaScript assignments related to math expressions in Chapter 5.

## Overview
A comprehensive collection of JavaScript exercises focused on mathematical operations and expressions. Each question builds foundational skills in performing arithmetic calculations, understanding operator precedence, and implementing mathematical logic in JavaScript.

## Contents
- **Question 1**: Math expression implementation
- **Question 2**: Math expression implementation
- **Question 3**: Math expression implementation
- **Question 4**: Math expression implementation
- **Question 5**: Math expression implementation
- **Question 6**: Math expression implementation
- **Question 7**: Math expression implementation
- **Question 8**: Math expression implementation
- **Question 9**: Math expression implementation
- **Question 10**: Math expression implementation
- **Question 11**: Math expression implementation
- **Question 12**: Math expression implementation
- **Question 13**: Math expression implementation

Each question directory contains:
- `index.html`: HTML file to run the JavaScript code
- `script.js`: JavaScript file containing the math expression implementation

## Purpose
This chapter focuses on learning JavaScript math expressions, including arithmetic operations, operator precedence, and mathematical calculations in JavaScript.

## Learning Objectives
- Understanding JavaScript arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %)
- Implementing mathematical calculations in JavaScript
- Learning about operator precedence and associativity
- Understanding how to use parentheses to control order of operations
- Working with numeric variables and expressions

## Mathematical Operators
- Addition: `+`
- Subtraction: `-`
- Multiplication: `*`
- Division: `/`
- Modulus (remainder): `%`
- Exponentiation: `**` (ES2016+)

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS (if applicable)

## Getting Started
To run any of the exercises:

1. Navigate to the specific question directory (e.g., `Question_1`)
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser
3. The JavaScript code in the `script.js` file will execute and display results

## How the Files Work
- `index.html`: Minimal HTML structure that loads and executes the JavaScript file
- `script.js`: JavaScript code implementing the specific math expression exercise

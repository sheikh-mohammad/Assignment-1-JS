## Project Structure

The project is organized by chapters, each focusing on specific JavaScript concepts:

```
.
├── Chapter_1_Alerts                    # Basic alerts and popups
├── Chapter_2_Variables_for_Strings     # String variables
├── Chapter_3_Variables_for_Numbers     # Number variables
├── Chapter_4_Variable_Names_Legal_and_Illegal # Variable naming rules
├── Chapter_5_Math_Expressions          # Mathematical operations
├── Chapter_6_to_9_Math_Expressions     # Advanced math expressions
├── Chapter_9_to_11_User_Input_and_Conditional_Statement # Input and conditionals
└── Chapter_12_to_13_If_Else_Else_If    # If-else control structures
```

Each chapter contains multiple questions (exercises), with each question in its own directory:
- `index.html` - HTML file for the exercise
- `script.js` - JavaScript file for the exercise (connected to HTML)

## How to Use

1. Navigate to any exercise directory
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to see the result
3. Edit `script.js` to implement your solution

## Assignment Overview

This collection covers fundamental JavaScript concepts including:
- Alert dialogs
- Variables (strings and numbers)
- Variable naming conventions
- Mathematical expressions
- User input handling
- Conditional statements (if/else/else if)

## File Connections

Each HTML file is connected to its corresponding JavaScript file via:
```html
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

This ensures that the JavaScript code in each exercise is properly loaded and executed.

## Learning Path

The assignments are structured in a way that builds from simple to more complex concepts:
1. Start with Chapter 1 to learn basic JavaScript alerts
2. Progress through variables, mathematical operations, and conditional statements
3. Each exercise builds upon previous concepts

## Requirements

- Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Text editor for modifying JavaScript files

## Contributing

This is a student assignment repository for learning JavaScript fundamentals. Each exercise is designed to reinforce specific JavaScript concepts through hands-on practice.

# Chapter 3: Variables for Numbers

This repository contains JavaScript assignments related to variables for numbers from the Saylani Mass IT Training program, Techno Kids Batch 7.

## Overview
A comprehensive collection of JavaScript exercises focused on working with numeric variables. Each question builds foundational skills in declaring, initializing, and manipulating numeric values in JavaScript.

## Contents
- **Question 1**: Numeric variable implementation
- **Question 2**: Numeric variable implementation
- **Question 3**: Numeric variable implementation
- **Question 4**: Numeric variable implementation

Each question directory contains:
- `index.html`: HTML file to run the JavaScript code
- `script.js`: JavaScript file containing the numeric variable implementation

## Purpose
This chapter focuses on learning how to declare and work with numeric variables in JavaScript, including understanding different number types and performing basic numeric operations.

## Learning Objectives
- Understanding how to declare numeric variables in JavaScript
- Learning to initialize variables with numeric values
- Implementing basic arithmetic operations with numbers
- Understanding JavaScript number types and precision
- Working with integer and floating-point numbers

## Number Types in JavaScript
- Integer numbers: `42`, `-10`, `0`
- Floating-point numbers: `3.14`, `-0.5`, `2.0`
- Scientific notation: `1.23e5`, `5e-3`
- Special numeric values: `Infinity`, `-Infinity`, `NaN`

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS (if applicable)

## Getting Started
To run any of the exercises:

1. Navigate to the specific question directory (e.g., `Question_1`)
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser
3. The JavaScript code in the `script.js` file will execute and display results

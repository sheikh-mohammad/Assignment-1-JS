This exercise practices declaring a variable without initialization and then assigning a string value to it.

## Files
- `index.html`: Minimal HTML that includes `script.js`
- `script.js`: JavaScript for this question - declares a variable without initialization and assigns a name value

## How to Run
- Open `index.html` in your browser
- Or use VS Code Live Server: right-click `index.html` → Open with Live Server

## Code Explanation
The script demonstrates:
- Variable declaration without initialization: `var myName;`
- Assigning a string value to the variable: `myName = "Sheikh Mohammad Ahmed";`

## Expected Output
The variable `myName` contains the string "Sheikh Mohammad Ahmed" which can be viewed in the browser console.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand variable declaration vs. initialization
- Practice assigning string values to variables after declaration
- Learn that variables can be declared without initial values

## Tips
- Use `console.log(myName)` to see the variable value in the browser console
- Try changing the assigned name value to see different outputs
- Experiment with declaring multiple variables before assigning values

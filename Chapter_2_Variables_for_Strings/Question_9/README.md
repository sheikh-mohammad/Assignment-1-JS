- `script.js`: JavaScript for this question - declares a variable with a design pattern and shows it in an alert

## How to Run
- Open `index.html` in your browser
- Or use VS Code Live Server: right-click `index.html` → Open with Live Server

## Code Explanation
The script demonstrates:
- Variable declaration with initialization containing a design pattern: `var design = "▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬";`
- Storing complex string patterns in variables
- Displaying the design pattern in an alert dialog

## Expected Output
An alert dialog will appear showing: "▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬"

## Learning Objectives
- Practice storing special character patterns in string variables
- Understand how to assign complex string values to variables
- See how decorative elements can be represented as strings
- Learn to display special characters and symbols in alerts

## Tips
- The design pattern uses various Unicode characters to create a decorative border
- You can change the design pattern to create your own decorative strings
- These types of patterns can be used for visual enhancement in text-based outputs
- Try using this pattern with document.write() to see it on the webpage

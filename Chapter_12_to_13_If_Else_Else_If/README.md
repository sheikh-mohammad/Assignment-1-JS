# Chapter 12-13: If, Else, Else If

This folder contains JavaScript assignments related to conditional statements (if, else, else if) in Chapters 12-13.

## Overview
A comprehensive collection of JavaScript exercises focused on conditional statements and control flow. Each question builds upon the concepts of if, else, and else if to create decision-making structures in JavaScript programs.

## Contents
- **Question 1**: Conditional statement implementation
- **Question 2**: Conditional statement implementation
- **Question 3**: Conditional statement implementation
- **Question 4**: Conditional statement implementation
- **Question 5**: Conditional statement implementation
- **Question 6**: Conditional statement implementation
- **Question 7**: Conditional statement implementation

Each question directory contains:
- `index.html`: HTML file to run the JavaScript code
- `script.js`: JavaScript file containing the conditional statement implementation

## Purpose
This chapter focuses on learning how to use JavaScript conditional statements (if, else, else if) to control the flow of execution based on different conditions.

## Learning Objectives
- Understanding the syntax and usage of if, else, and else if statements
- Implementing decision-making logic in JavaScript
- Creating nested conditional statements
- Comparing values using conditional operators
- Handling multiple scenarios using else if chains

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS (if applicable)

## Getting Started
To run any of the exercises:

1. Navigate to the specific question directory (e.g., `Question_1`)
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser
3. The JavaScript code in the `script.js` file will execute and display results

## How the Files Work
- `index.html`: Minimal HTML structure that loads and executes the JavaScript file
- `script.js`: JavaScript code implementing the specific conditional statement exercise

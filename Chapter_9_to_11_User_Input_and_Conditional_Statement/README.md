# Chapter 9-11: User Input and Conditional Statement

This folder contains JavaScript assignments related to user input and conditional statements in Chapters 9-11.

## Overview
A comprehensive collection of JavaScript exercises focused on user interaction and decision-making logic. Each question builds skills in collecting user input and implementing conditional logic to create interactive programs.

## Contents
- **Question 1**: User input and conditional statement implementation
- **Question 2**: User input and conditional statement implementation
- **Question 3**: User input and conditional statement implementation
- **Question 4**: User input and conditional statement implementation
- **Question 5**: User input and conditional statement implementation
- **Question 6**: User input and conditional statement implementation
- **Question 7**: User input and conditional statement implementation
- **Question 8**: User input and conditional statement implementation
- **Question 9**: User input and conditional statement implementation
- **Question 10**: User input and conditional statement implementation
- **Question 11**: User input and conditional statement implementation

Each question directory contains:
- `index.html`: HTML file to run the JavaScript code
- `script.js`: JavaScript file containing the user input and conditional statement implementation

## Purpose
This chapter focuses on learning JavaScript user input methods (like prompt) and conditional statement implementations (if/else statements) for Chapters 9-11.

## Learning Objectives
- Understanding how to collect user input using JavaScript
- Implementing conditional logic with if, else if, and else statements
- Creating interactive programs based on user responses
- Using comparison operators for decision making
- Handling multiple possible user inputs

## User Input Methods
- `prompt()`: To get input from the user
- `confirm()`: To get yes/no response from the user
- `alert()`: To display messages to the user

## Conditional Statement Structures
- Simple if statement
- if-else statement
- if-else if-else statement
- Nested conditional statements
- Logical operators (&&, ||, !)

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS (if applicable)

## Getting Started
To run any of the exercises:

1. Navigate to the specific question directory (e.g., `Question_1`)
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser
3. The JavaScript code in the `script.js` file will execute and display results

## How the Files Work
- `index.html`: Minimal HTML structure that loads and executes the JavaScript file
- `script.js`: JavaScript code implementing the specific user input and conditional statement exercise

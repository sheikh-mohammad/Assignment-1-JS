# Question 4 – Variables for Strings

This exercise practices declaring multiple string variables and displaying them with alert dialogs.

## Files
- `index.html`: Minimal HTML that includes `script.js`
- `script.js`: JavaScript for this question - declares multiple variables and shows them in separate alerts

## How to Run
- Open `index.html` in your browser
- Or use VS Code Live Server: right-click `index.html` → Open with Live Server

## Code Explanation
The script demonstrates:
- Variable declaration with initialization: `var studentName = "John Doe";`
- Declaring multiple string variables for student information
- Using `alert()` to display each variable value in sequence

## Expected Output
Three alert dialogs will appear sequentially showing:
1. "John Doe" (student name)
2. "15 years old" (student age) 
3. "Certified Mobile Application Development" (student course)

## Learning Objectives
- Practice declaring multiple string variables
- Learn to initialize variables during declaration
- Understand sequential execution of multiple alert calls
- Work with related data stored in different variables

## Tips
- Each alert will show one by one - click OK to see the next
- You can change any of the variable values to see different outputs
- Try concatenating variables to create a single message

# Question 3 – Variables for Strings

This exercise practices declaring a variable, assigning a string value, and displaying it with an alert dialog.

## Files
- `index.html`: Minimal HTML that includes `script.js`
- `script.js`: JavaScript for this question - declares a variable, assigns "Hello World!" and shows it in an alert

## How to Run
- Open `index.html` in your browser
- Or use VS Code Live Server: right-click `index.html` → Open with Live Server

## Code Explanation
The script demonstrates:
- Variable declaration without initialization: `var message;`
- Assigning a string value to the variable: `message = "Hello World!";`
- Displaying the message in an alert dialog: `alert(message);`

## Expected Output
An alert dialog will appear showing "Hello World!" when the page loads.

## Learning Objectives
- Practice variable declaration and initialization
- Learn how to use `alert()` to display messages
- Understand how to use variables in function calls

## Tips
- The alert will appear immediately when the page loads
- You can change the message content to see different alerts
- Try replacing the variable with a direct string in the alert function

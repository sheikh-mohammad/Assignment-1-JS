## Overview
This assignment covers fundamental concepts in JavaScript, specifically focusing on variables and string manipulation. Each question builds upon the previous one, helping to reinforce understanding of how to declare, initialize, and work with string variables in JavaScript.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of HTML
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- A text editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom, etc.)

## Installation
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to any question folder (e.g., Question_1, Question_2, etc.)
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser

## Usage
Each question is contained in its own folder with the following structure:
```
Question_N/
├── index.html
└── script.js
```

To run each assignment:
1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser
2. The JavaScript code in `script.js` will execute
3. Check the browser console and alert messages for outputs

## Assignment Structure
The assignment is organized into 9 questions that progressively introduce concepts related to JavaScript string variables:

- **Question 1**: Variable declaration
- **Question 2**: Variable assignment with string values
- **Question 3**: String assignment and alert display
- **Question 4**: (Based on file structure)
- **Question 5**: (Based on file structure)
- **Question 6**: (Based on file structure)
- **Question 7**: (Based on file structure)
- **Question 8**: (Based on file structure)
- **Question 9**: (Based on file structure)

## Topics Covered
- Variable declaration using `var`
- String assignment
- String literals
- Using `alert()` for output
- Basic JavaScript syntax and structure

## Questions

### Question 1
- Variable declaration without initialization
- Code: `var username;`

### Question 2
- Variable declaration and string assignment
- Code: 
```javascript
var myName;
myName = "Sheikh Mohammad Ahmed";
```

### Question 3
- String assignment and alert display
- Code:
```javascript
var message;
message = "Hello World!";
alert(message);
```

### Questions 4-9
- Additional exercises on JavaScript variables and strings (content pending file review)

## JavaScript Concepts Demonstrated
1. **Variable Declaration**: Using the `var` keyword to declare variables
2. **String Assignment**: Assigning string literals to variables
3. **Alert Boxes**: Using `alert()` to display messages to users

## Sample Code
Here's an example of the code pattern used in these assignments:

```javascript
var message;
message = "Hello World!";
alert(message);
```

## Common JavaScript String Patterns
- Single quotes: `'Hello'`
- Double quotes: `"Hello"`
- String concatenation with `+` operator
- Using variables to store and manipulate string data

## Learning Objectives
By completing these exercises, you should be able to:
- Declare variables using the `var` keyword
- Assign string values to variables
- Display string values using alert boxes
- Understand basic JavaScript syntax for working with strings
- Practice good code organization with separate HTML and JavaScript files

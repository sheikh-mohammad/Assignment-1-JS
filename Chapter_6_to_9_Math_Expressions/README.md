# Chapter 6-9: Math Expressions

This folder contains JavaScript assignments related to math expressions in Chapters 6-9.

## Overview
A comprehensive collection of JavaScript exercises focused on advanced mathematical operations and expressions. Each question builds upon foundational arithmetic skills to introduce more complex mathematical concepts and expressions in JavaScript.

## Contents
- **Question 1**: Math expression implementation
- **Question 2**: Math expression implementation
- **Question 3**: Math expression implementation
- **Question 4**: Math expression implementation
- **Question 5**: Math expression implementation
- **Question 6**: Math expression implementation

Each question directory contains:
- `index.html`: HTML file to run the JavaScript code
- `script.js`: JavaScript file containing the math expression implementation

## Purpose
This chapter focuses on learning JavaScript math expressions, including arithmetic operations, operator precedence, and mathematical calculations in JavaScript for Chapters 6-9.

## Learning Objectives
- Understanding advanced mathematical operations in JavaScript
- Implementing more complex arithmetic calculations
- Using increment and decrement operators (++ and --)
- Working with compound assignment operators (+=, -=, *=, /=)
- Understanding mathematical functions and methods

## Advanced Mathematical Concepts
- Increment/Decrement: `++`, `--`
- Compound Assignment: `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`
- Math object methods: `Math.max()`, `Math.min()`, `Math.round()`, etc.
- Order of operations and parentheses usage
- Working with decimals and precision

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS (if applicable)

## Getting Started
To run any of the exercises:

1. Navigate to the specific question directory (e.g., `Question_1`)
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser
3. The JavaScript code in the `script.js` file will execute and display results

## How the Files Work
- `index.html`: Minimal HTML structure that loads and executes the JavaScript file
- `script.js`: JavaScript code implementing the specific math expression exercise

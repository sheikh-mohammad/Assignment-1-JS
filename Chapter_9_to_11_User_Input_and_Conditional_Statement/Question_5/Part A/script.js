var a = 4;
if (++a === 5) {
    alert("given condition for variable a is true");
}

// Output:
// alert("given condition for variable a is true");

// Reason: This script produces output because ++a is pre-increment and pre-increment means first update and then use it as well. That's why the condition becomes true.

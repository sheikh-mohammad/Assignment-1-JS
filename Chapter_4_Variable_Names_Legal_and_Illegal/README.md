This folder contains JavaScript assignments related to variable naming conventions (legal and illegal) in Chapter 4.

## Overview
A comprehensive collection of JavaScript exercises focused on understanding the rules for legal and illegal variable names in JavaScript. Each question explores the syntax and conventions for creating valid variable identifiers.

## Contents
- **Question 1**: Variable naming implementation
- **Question 2**: Variable naming implementation
- **Question 3**: Variable naming implementation

Each question directory contains:
- `index.html`: HTML file to run the JavaScript code
- `script.js`: JavaScript file containing the variable naming implementation

## Purpose
This chapter focuses on learning JavaScript variable naming rules, including legal and illegal variable names, and best practices for naming variables in JavaScript.

## Learning Objectives
- Understanding JavaScript variable naming conventions
- Identifying legal and illegal variable names
- Recognizing JavaScript reserved words

## Variable Naming Rules
- Variable names must begin with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($)

- Cannot use reserved JavaScript keywords as variable names
- Should be descriptive and meaningful

## Technologies Used

- CSS (if applicable)

## Getting Started
To run any of the exercises:

1. Navigate to the specific question directory (e.g., `Question_1`)
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser
3. The JavaScript code in the `script.js` file will execute and display results

## How the Files Work
- `index.html`: Minimal HTML structure that loads and executes the JavaScript file
- `script.js`: JavaScript code implementing the specific variable naming exercise
